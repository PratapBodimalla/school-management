# User Interface Design Document – Multi-Tenant School Management SaaS

## Layout Structure
- **Dashboard-Centric**: Each role (Admin, Teacher, Student) has its own role-specific dashboard.  
- **Navigation**: Persistent left sidebar for main sections (Classes, Students, Teachers, Timetable, Fees).  
- **Header**: Top bar with search, notifications, and user profile dropdown.  
- **Main Content Area**: Displays widgets, tables, or forms depending on the task.  
- **Footer (optional)**: Quick links, version info, support.

## Core Components
- **Sidebar Menu** – Role-based navigation items (Admin: Classes, Fees; Teacher: Timetable, Attendance; Student: Timetable, Fees).  
- **Dashboard Widgets** – At-a-glance cards for key actions (e.g., “Pending Fees,” “Today’s Classes,” “Attendance Summary”).  
- **Tables & Lists** – For student/teacher records, attendance logs, and fee history.  
- **Forms** – For onboarding users, updating profiles, recording fees.  
- **Calendar View** – Weekly/daily timetable for teachers and students.  
- **Notifications/Alerts** – Highlight overdue fees, low attendance, or upcoming holidays.

## Interaction Patterns
- **Click to Drill Down** – Dashboard cards lead to detailed tables or forms.  
- **Inline Actions** – Quick actions within tables (e.g., mark attendance, edit profile).  
- **Global Search** – Search bar to find students, teachers, or classes across the tenant.  
- **Role-Based Access** – Users only see and act on what their role permits.  
- **Confirmation Modals** – For critical actions (e.g., delete user, finalize fee collection).

## Visual Design Elements & Color Scheme
- **Primary Colors**: Neutral base (white/gray) with role-specific accents.  
  - Admin – Blue accents.  
  - Teacher – Green accents.  
  - Student – Orange accents.  
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between navigation (sidebar), global actions (header), and task workspace (main content).  
- **Icons**: Consistent iconography for navigation and quick actions.  
- **Feedback States**: Success = green, Error = red, Warning = yellow, Info = blue.  

---

## Mobile, Web App, Desktop Considerations
- **Web App (Primary)** – Full-feature dashboards with sidebar navigation.  
- **Mobile** – Sidebar collapses into a hamburger menu; dashboard cards stack vertically; calendar and lists optimized for swipe/scroll.  
- **Desktop (Admin-heavy use)** – Expanded data tables and multi-column views for efficiency.  

---

## Typography
- **Primary Font**: Sans-serif (e.g., Inter, Roboto, or Open Sans).  
- **Hierarchy**:  
  - Headers: Bold, larger size.  
  - Body text: Medium weight, high readability.  
  - Tables: Compact but legible.  
- **Consistency**: Same font family across all tenants for branding consistency.  

---

## Accessibility
- **Color Contrast**: Meet WCAG AA standards for text and background.  
- **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements navigable with tab/arrow keys.  
- **Screen Reader Labels**: Semantic HTML with ARIA labels for buttons, forms, and tables.  
- **Scalable Text**: Support for zoom and larger font sizes without breaking layouts.  
- **Responsive Design**: Works across devices without loss of functionality.
